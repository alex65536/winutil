# WinUtil
A tiny object-oriented wrapper for creating small GUI applications using Win32 API

## Requirements
To use the library, you should use C++14 or later. Also, as it uses Win32 API, Windows is required. If you don't like using non-free software, compiling it with MinGW and running with Wine also works well.

## Documentation
I'm too lazy to write it :) Refer to `demo.cpp` if you want to see how to use it.
